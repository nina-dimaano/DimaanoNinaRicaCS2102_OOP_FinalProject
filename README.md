# KnowTify: Your Personal Learning Companion

---

## **Project Overview**
**KnowTify** is a Java-based application designed to help students efficiently organize their study routines and enhance their academic performance.It integrates advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a cohesive, modular system for managing tasks, schedules, and subjects. It features robust task management tools that allow students to track assignments, set due dates, and analyze task complexity, along with recommended daily preparation times. The system also offers dynamic class schedule management that automatically updates based on the current day, ensuring students never miss a class. With a seamless registration and login process, KnowTify provides personalized dashboards where students can manage tasks, view schedules, and analyze subjects. The subject analysis function tailors study times based on material complexity, while the profile system tracks study challenges and suggests personalized methods for improvement. By combining these features, KnowTify supports students in maximizing their productivity, effectively managing their time, and achieving academic success.

### **Key Features**:
- Manage and analyze tasks with due dates, complexity levels, and recommended daily prep times.
- Organize and view detailed class schedules that automatically changes based on the day.
- Seamlessly handle register and login processes.
- Navigate a dynamic dashboard tailored to student needs.
- Subject analysis function that customizes study times based on the complexity of the material.
- Profile system that tracks individual study problems and suggests appropriate study method.

## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**
### **1. Abstraction**
The **Manager** class is an abstract class that provides a unified interface for managing different entities, such as tasks and subjects. Each subclass, such as **TaskManager** and **SubjectManager**, implements specific behaviors while hiding the implementation details from the user. Additionally, helper methods like `ordinalSuffix()` abstract complex logic for formatting user inputs.

### **2. Inheritance**
Core functionality is reused across the application by extending abstract classes. For instance, **SubjectManager** and **TaskManager** inherit methods and attributes from the **Manager** superclass, reducing code redundancy and enhancing scalability. Similarly, **ConcreteUser** extends the **User** class to implement specific functionality for login and registration processes.

### **3. Polymorphism**
The **Manager** class allows its subclasses to override methods like `addItem()` and `viewItems()`. This ensures that each manager (e.g., TaskManager) behaves differently based on its specific requirements while adhering to the same method signature. Polymorphism is also evident in the handling of input validation and user interaction methods across different manager classes.

### **4. Encapsulation**
Classes like **User** and **Dashboard** encapsulate their data, ensuring that sensitive information (e.g., login credentials) is accessed only through controlled methods, maintaining data integrity and security. Methods such as `addItem()` and `getDayOfWeekString()` ensure that only valid inputs are processed, shielding internal data structures from corruption.
